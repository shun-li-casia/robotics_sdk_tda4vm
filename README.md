## Overview

The Jacinto Robotics SDK provides a robotics software development environment for TI Jacinto and Sitara Processors. It also offers software building blocks and example demos that can be leveraged in robotics software development. The SDK runs in Docker container environments on:

```{only} tag_j7x
- [Processor SDK Linux for TDA4VM {{RELEASE}}](https://www.ti.com/tool/download/PROCESSOR-SDK-LINUX-SK-TDA4VM)
- [Processor SDK Linux for AM68A {{RELEASE}}](https://www.ti.com/tool/download/PROCESSOR-SDK-LINUX-AM68A)
- [Processor SDK Linux for AM69A {{RELEASE}}](https://www.ti.com/tool/download/PROCESSOR-SDK-LINUX-AM69A)
```
```{only} tag_am62a
- [Processor SDK Linux for AM62A {{RELEASE}}](https://www.ti.com/tool/download/PROCESSOR-SDK-LINUX-AM62A)
```

In the next section, you will find detailed steps for setting up Docker container environments for ROS Noetic and ROS 2 Foxy on the Processor SDK Linux for Edge AI. The Robotics SDK allows:

- Optimized software implementation of computation-intensive software building blocks (including deep-learning, vision, perception, mapping and localization) on deep-learning core (C7x/MMA), DSP cores, hardware accelerators built-in on the processors.
- Application software development on the target using libraries optimized on the TI Processor along with many open-source libraries and packages including, for example, OpenCV, Point-Cloud Library (PCL), and more.

Figure 1 shows the software libraries and components provided by the Robotics SDK.

### TI Vision Apps Library

The TI Vision Apps Library is included in the pre-built base image for the Processor SDK Linux for Edge AI. The library provides a set of APIs, including:

- TI OpenVX kernels and software infrastructure
- Imaging and vision applications
- Perception applications
- Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) applications

### Open-Source Deep-Learning Runtime

The Processor SDK Linux for Edge AI also supports the following open-source deep-learning runtime libraries:

- TVM/Neo-AI-DLR
- TFLite Runtime
- ONNX Runtime

For more details on open-source deep-learning runtime on TI Processors, please check [TI Edge AI Cloud](https://dev.ti.com/edgeai/). The Robotics SDK provides a versatile vision CNN node optimized for TI Processors that supports many deep-learning models for object detection and semantic segmentation operations.

Figure 2 shows a representative deep-learning and compute-intensive demo application developed with the Robotics SDK.
